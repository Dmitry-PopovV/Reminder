# About
Reminder is a single-page calendar application designed for note-taking purposes.
Upon authentication via Google, users gain access to creating and modifying event notes.
Users can specify whether an event occurs once or set up recurring schedules with flexible options.
These notes are then conveniently delivered to users via email at their designated times.
